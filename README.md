# CreateCCModemFix
Fixes cc modems on create contraptions
This works by adding the "#create:brittle" tag to the wireless and ender modems, and to anything with the "#computercraft:wired_modem" tag.
This will also include the full block wired modem, but I do not believe that this breaks anything, and cannot think of a way to not include it.

Both the createccfix folder and zip work as datapacks - you just need to install it using your preferred method of installing datapacks.

If you have any issues or ideas for improvement, create an issue.

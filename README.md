# CreateCCModemFix
Fixes cc modems - and soon, other blocks - on create contraptions.
This works by adding the "#create:brittle" tag to the wireless and ender modems, and to anything with the "#computercraft:wired_modem" tag.
This will also include the full block wired modem, but I do not believe that this breaks anything, and cannot think of a way to not include it. The fix was suggested by the author of this [issue](https://github.com/tweaked-programs/cccbridge/issues/82).

Both the createccfix folder and zip work as datapacks - you just need to install it using your preferred method of installing datapacks.

The CC modems have been fixed in a dev version of cc:tweaked, but there are other blocks, such as moss carpets, that still need this tag, so I shall keep updating this datapack into the future.

If you have any issues or ideas for improvement, create an issue.

If you have other blocks that have the same problem, please comment on the issue.

Modrinth - also has the datapack packaged as a fabric and forge mod for ease of use:
